# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes information on passengers such as their age, gender, class, and cabin.

# Data Preprocessing
The Titanic dataset contained missing data and categorical variables which required preprocessing. The missing data like age was handled using KNN imputation, and the categorical variables were encoded to numerical variables.

# Model Selection
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the Titanic dataset. The models evaluated included logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and naive bias. After evaluating the models, decision tree and random forest were found to perform the best.

# Conclusion
The random forest and descion tree models were ultimately selected as the best models for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic, with an accuracy score of 0.987. these models can be used to predict the survival of new passengers and provide insights into the factors that contributed to survival on the Titanic.
